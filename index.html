<h1>UC GPA and Enrollment Visualization</h1>
<p>Welcome to the UC GPA and enrollment visualization</p>

<h2>First Plot</h2>
<p>Let see a simple comparison between the FR App and Adm vs. TR App and Adm.</p>
<div id="plot_1">
</div>
<p>
    This is very interesting! It is almost linear relationship between App and Adm.
    We see that it is linear increasing as time pass.
    It turns our that you need a higher GPA then before inorder to get admit in UC.
</p>

<h2>Second Plot</h2>
<p>
    Let see this relationship in a different way.
    We draw a line graph to see if it is actually true that the GPA requirement is increasing.
</p>
<div id="plot_2">
    <div id="radio_q2">
        <input type="radio" id="plot2_app" name="gpa" value="App GPA" checked="checked">
        <label for="plot2_app">App GPA</label>
        <input type="radio" id="plot2_adm" name="gpa" value="Adm GPA">
        <label for="plot2_adm">Adm GPA</label>
        <input type="radio" id="plot2_enrl" name="gpa" value="Enrl GPA">
        <label for="plot2_enrl">Enrl GPA</label>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    It turns out that before the year of 2013, the GPA requirement are almost the same!
    However, after the year of 2013, the GPA requirement is increasing exponentially!
</p>

<h2>Third Plot</h2>
<p>
    Why is that the case?
    We can try to show that if the number of application is increasing or not.
    We stacked bar chart to see the total number of FR and TR app
</p>
<div id="plot_3">
</div>
<p>
    We see that the number of application is increasing linearly.
</p>

<h2>Fourth Plot</h2>
<p>
    Let see which county get the most application!
    We draw a heatmap of the number of application received each year.
</p>
<div id="plot_4">
    <div class="slider_4">
        <input type="range" min="1994" max="2022" value="1994" id="year_slider">
        <label for="year_slider">
            Year: <span id="year"></span>
        </label>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    As the year pass by, the heatmap started to become darker.
    This is especially true for Los Angeles county!
    Other countries around the Bay Area such as Contra Costa, Alameda, Santa Clara also see increasing of number of application.
    In southern california, Riverside, San Deigo, and Orange counties also see a noticeable increase in enrollment.
    We stacked bar chart to see the total number of FR and TR app
</p>

<h2>Fifth Plot</h2>
<p>
    Our last plot is to see the IQR for FR and TR.
    We use a box plot to see if there is a different between the GPA of TR and FR.
</p>
<div id="plot_5">
</div>
<p>
    We see that there is a noticeable gap in terms of GPA requirement for FR and TR.
    It turns out that your need a higher GPA to be accepted by the UC vs TR!
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    We see that there is a noticeable gap in terms of GPA requirement for FR and TR.
    We also see the linear increase in terms of GPA requirement across FR and TR.
    We also see an increase on number of application, specially in the Bay Area and southern california.
    However, it is not the end the day if you do not get admitted at FR.
    You still have a change to apply as TR.
    The GPA requirement is even lower then FR!
